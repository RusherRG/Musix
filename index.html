                Darling just dive right in
                And follow my lead
                Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet 
                I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
                'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                Not knowing what it was
                I will not give you up this time
                But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
                And in your eyes you're holding mine
                Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
                Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
                When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
                But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</div>
